# Nonlinear Stochastic Problem Reformulated to Quadratic
## An Application of a more complex Newsvendor Model
For this project, I did the main problem of formulating the more complex newsvendor model into a quadratic program as well as providing an explanation as to how and why the solution works. My work can be seen on project 4 (1-4). My group members finished the bootstrapping sample part of the project and the final document is located on project 4 (final).
