# Non Linear Programming
This details some of the nonlinear problems that I've dealt with over the course of the semester. 

## Area Optimization
The area of a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c is 
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt{𝑠(𝑠 − 𝑎)(𝑠 − 𝑏)(𝑠 − 𝑐)})
$$\sqrt{𝑠(𝑠 − 𝑎)(𝑠 − 𝑏)(𝑠 − 𝑐)}$$ where
s is half of the perimeter of the triangle. We have 60 ft of fencing and want to make a
triangular fence which contains as much area as possible. Formulate and solve an NLP
to find the optimal side lengths of the fence.
